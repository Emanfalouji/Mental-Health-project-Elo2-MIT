## 1️⃣ Key Mental-Health Challenges

| Condition | Description | Common Symptoms |
|----------|-------------|----------------|
| PTSD (Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder) | Exposure to traumatic events like bombing, death, displacement | Flashbacks, nightmares, panic attacks, emotional numbness |
| Anxiety Disorders | Constant fear and uncertainty about safety & future | Rapid heartbeat, sweating, worry, sleep problems |
| Depression | Hopelessness after loss of home, family, or life plans | Loss of motivation, sadness, withdrawal from social life |
| Survivor’s Guilt | Feeling guilty for staying alive or having more safety | Self-blame, isolation, sadness |

## 3️⃣ Existing Digital Solutions — and Their Limitations

| Existing Tool | Strength | Limitation for War-Affected Youth |
|--------------|----------|----------------------------------|
| BetterHelp, TalkSpace | Professional support online | Very expensive, English-only |
| Telegram support groups | Fast and accessible | No supervision, misinformation risk |
| Mental-health blogs & videos | Helpful coping tips | Not personalized, no feedback |
| Local NGOs helplines | Free help | Not always available, busy/slow |

🚫 There is **no platform designed for war trauma + low internet + cultural sensitivity** at the same time.

## Summary Conclusion
Young people experiencing war urgently need a **trusted, empathetic, and accessible** mental-health support platform. Existing solutions fail to fully meet their needs due to cost, language barriers, safety risks, and low connectivity.

This domain research confirms that the proposed platform could **fill a real gap** and potentially change lives.
