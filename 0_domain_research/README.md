## Background Review

War and displacement have profound psychological consequences, especially for young adults, who often experience repeated trauma during their most formative developmental years. In regions such as Gaza, decades of blockade, recurrent military escalations, displacement, and economic deprivation have created chronic conditions of instability. Research consistently shows that exposure to war-related trauma — including airstrikes, loss of loved ones, displacement, and destruction of homes — significantly increases the risk of depression, anxiety, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and long-term psychological distress. Studies from conflict-affected populations indicate that young adults often exhibit high levels of hypervigilance, sleep disturbances, emotional numbness, concentration difficulties, and impaired daily functioning. Global health agencies such as WHO, UNICEF, and UNRWA repeatedly warn that conflict-affected youth face some of the highest mental-health burdens in the world.

## 1. Psychological Impact of War on Young Adults

- **1 in 5 people** living in conflict settings suffers from a mental-health condition such as depression, anxiety, PTSD, bipolar disorder, or schizophrenia ([WHO, 2025](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/mental-health-in-emergencies)).
- **PTSD rates in conflict zones** are significantly higher than global averages, often reaching **30–50%** among young adults exposed to war.
- WHO reports that exposure to bombardment, displacement, loss of family members, and destruction of homes sharply increases risks of:
  - Chronic anxiety  
  - Sleep disturbances  
  - Emotional dysregulation  
  - Impaired academic and work functioning  
  - Long-term trauma

## 2. Mental-Health Crisis in Gaza

The mental-health situation in Gaza is among the most severe worldwide. Recent studies highlight extremely high prevalence rates of mental disorders:

- **PTSD:** 54% in children, 40% in adults  
- **Depression:** 41% in children, 45% in adults  
- **Anxiety:** 34% in children, 37% in adults  
(Source: [WHO EMRO, 2025](https://www.emro.who.int/afg/a-narrative-review-of-mental-health-and-psychosocial-impact-of-the-war-in-gaza.html))

A 2025 study published in *Chronic Stress* reported that during recent violent escalations and displacement in Gaza:

- **79.3%** of young adults experienced moderate or higher anxiety  
- **84.5%** moderate or higher depression  
- **67.8%** showed symptoms of PTSD  
(Source: [Chronic Stress, 2025](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/24705470251334943))

These prevalence rates are substantially higher than earlier regional estimates, indicating a worsening mental-health crisis driven by continuous exposure to violence, displacement, insecurity, and limited access to psychological support.

UNICEF describes the escalating crisis:

> **“Gaza is the real-world embodiment of hell on earth for its one million children. And it’s getting worse day by day, as we see the horrific impact of daily airstrikes and military operations on Palestinian children.”**  
> — UNICEF, Geneva, 18 October 2024

Reports from UNICEF, UNRWA, and WHO further indicate:

- **More than 80%** of Gaza’s children and young adults show signs of anxiety, depression, or PTSD symptoms (UNICEF, 2024).

### Consequences of Displacement on Identity and Social Support

Displacement has also fractured social, cultural, and religious continuity, creating deep identity challenges among young adults. Over **85% of Gaza’s population** has been forcibly displaced, with many living in overcrowded shelters lacking safety, privacy, and basic resources. The loss of family networks, community structures, and a sense of belonging intensifies psychological distress and increases vulnerability to mental-health disorders.

## Rationale for Digital Mental-Health Solutions

The urgent need for accessible mental-health support in conflict-affected populations has led global health agencies to emphasize the potential of digital platforms as scalable, cost-effective, and stigma-reducing interventions. According to the World Health Organization’s 2023 Digital Health Report, technology-assisted mental-health care can significantly expand service availability in regions where traditional systems are under-resourced or disrupted. In conflict ecosystems like Gaza, where infrastructure damage, displacement, and insecurity restrict physical access to care, digital tools represent an essential alternative rather than a supplementary resource.

Digital mental-health interventions have several advantages:

- **Accessibility in restricted environments:** Digital tools can reach individuals in shelters, temporary housing, or conflict zones where travel is unsafe or impossible.
- **Reduced stigma:** Many young adults hesitate to seek face-to-face therapy due to cultural stigmas. Anonymous digital platforms allow them to access support privately and safely.
- **Scalability:** A digital platform can serve thousands simultaneously, reducing strain on overstretched mental-health systems.
- **Cost-effectiveness:** Compared to in-person clinical infrastructure, digital solutions require fewer financial and human resources.
- **Personalization and cultural adaptability:** Platforms can be designed to incorporate culturally relevant language, trauma-sensitive content, and localized resources.
- **Continuity of care across borders:** Refugees moving between Gaza, Egypt, Türkiye, and Europe often lose access to consistent mental-health services. A digital platform can provide stable, ongoing support regardless of geographic location.

UNICEF and WHO both recommend developing digital mental-health programs for youth in emergencies, noting that digital tools can offer psychoeducation, basic triage, crisis support, and pathways to connect with professionals when available. Existing evidence shows that digital interventions can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety, and PTSD, particularly when combined with structured guidance or human support. For displaced and war-affected populations, technological solutions are often the only feasible means of sustaining mental-health care.
