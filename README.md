# 🌱 Mental Health Support Platform for War-Affected Youth

## Project Summary
This project focuses on designing a trauma-aware and accessible digital platform to support young adults affected by war. The platform connects users with trained volunteers and mental-health professionals. A key priority is accessibility for people still living inside conflict zones such as Gaza -palestine, where connectivity, safety, and healthcare access are extremely limited.Also, those displaced to host countries who experience isolation and stigma.

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Millions of young adults who have endured war face severe emotional and psychological challenges including PTSD, anxiety, depression, and deep loneliness.

However, access to mental-health services is often blocked by:

- Destroyed local healthcare systems
- Ongoing trauma and danger in conflict zones
- Financial hardship
- Language and cultural barriers
- Long waiting times for services in host countries
- Fear of judgment and stigma
- Limited internet and electricity reliability

There is a critical need for a **safe, low-cost, and culturally sensitive** mental-health support platform. It must provide **self-help tools that work even with low connectivity**, and a **trusted connection** to volunteers and mental-health professionals.
