# 🚶‍♀️🚶‍♂️ User Journey Mapping

This document illustrates how two primary users — **Aya** (inside Gaza) and **Omar** (in a host country) — would discover, join, and use the mental-health support platform. The goal is to understand their emotions, needs, and pain points at each step to design a more human-centered solution.

## 🧍 Journey 1 — Aya (Living Inside Gaza)

| Stage | What Aya Does | What She Feels | Pain Points | Opportunity for the Platform |
|------|----------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------------|
| 1️⃣ Awareness | Sees a post shared by a friend about a safe emotional support app | Curious but nervous | Fear of being judged | Clear messaging: safe & anonymous |
| 2️⃣ Access | Opens the app on her low-internet mobile | Hopeful but anxious | Weak internet, slow load | Lightweight UI + offline support |
| 3️⃣ Onboarding | Creates anonymous account — no real name | Relieved | Doesn’t want long forms | Simple sign-up with emojis/mood check |
| 4️⃣ Request Support | Writes “I feel scared all the time…” in chat | Vulnerable, shaky | Trust barrier | Warm trauma-aware responses |
| 5️⃣ First Session | Starts text conversation with trained listener | Slowly hopeful | Fear of triggers | Gentle communication guidelines |
| 6️⃣ Self-help Tools | Uses breathing exercise during panic | More in control | Triggers can appear suddenly | One-tap grounding tools always visible |
| 7️⃣ Returning Support | Continues short, periodic conversations | Connected and calmer | Electricity / network cuts | Conversations saved locally |

**Insight:**  
Aya needs a **low-bandwidth**, **anonymous**, **emotionally safe** environment that supports sudden trauma spikes.
