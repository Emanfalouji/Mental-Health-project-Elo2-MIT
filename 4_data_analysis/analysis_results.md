## 1. Overview of Mental-Health Indicators

Across the dataset, participants exhibit varying levels of psychological distress, depression severity, and PTSD symptoms. The distributions of these indicators show moderate-to-high levels of mental-health burden across the population, consistent with chronic exposure to stressors and conflict-related events. Standardized measures such as **Depression SD**, **PTSD Index**, and the **Psychological Distress Aggregate** provide reliable insights into underlying emotional and trauma-related conditions.

## 2. Correlation Between Mental-Health Measures

A correlation matrix revealed meaningful positive relationships among the primary mental-health indicators. The **Psychological Distress Aggregate** showed strong correlations with **Depression SD** (r ≈ 0.70) and **PTSD Index** (r ≈ 0.64), indicating that individuals experiencing high levels of trauma or depressive symptoms are also more likely to report elevated distress.  
The connection between **Distress SWIN SD** and the other indicators was moderate but still meaningful.  
These patterns highlight overlapping symptom dimensions and demonstrate the interconnected nature of trauma, depression, and general psychological distress.

## 3. Gender Differences in Psychological Distress

A comparison of average distress levels by gender revealed that **male participants reported slightly higher psychological distress than female participants**.  
Although the difference is modest, this finding suggests that men in this dataset may be experiencing elevated stressors or greater exposure to certain trauma-related circumstances.  
This pattern highlights the need for gender-sensitive mental-health strategies that address distinct social, economic, and psychosocial pressures faced by both men and women.

## 4. Relationship Between PTSD and Depression

Scatterplot analysis demonstrated a **weak but positive relationship** between **PTSD Index** and **Depression SD**. Participants with higher PTSD scores tend to show slightly higher depression severity.  
Although the correlation is not strong (r ≈ 0.11), it remains clinically relevant: trauma-related symptoms and emotional distress often co-occur, and even mild associations may indicate increased vulnerability among trauma-exposed individuals.  
The regression line reinforces this upward trend, reflecting a genuine but modest link between these two mental-health constructs.

## 5. Regional Differences: Gaza Strip vs West Bank

Participants were categorized by region using their governorate codes. Clear regional differences emerged across the mental-health indicators.

### 5.1 Psychological Distress by Region

Participants living in the **Gaza Strip** reported **higher psychological distress** than those in the West Bank.  
This aligns with Gaza’s prolonged conflict exposure, economic deprivation, infrastructural challenges, and broader humanitarian constraints.

### 5.2 Depression Severity by Region

Average **Depression SD** scores were also higher among participants in the Gaza Strip.  
Persistent insecurity, limited mobility, unemployment, and continuous stress contribute to increasingly severe depressive symptoms in Gaza.

### 5.3 PTSD Levels by Region

The **PTSD Index** was higher in Gaza compared to the West Bank.  
This is consistent with repeated traumatic events in Gaza—such as displacement, airstrikes, infrastructure destruction, and loss of loved ones—affecting both short-term and long-term psychological well-being.

Collectively, these regional patterns emphasize the need for **targeted mental-health interventions in Gaza**, where psychosocial stressors are more intense and persistent.

## 6. Summary of Key Findings

- Mental-health indicators (distress, depression, PTSD) are strongly interconnected.  
- Males show slightly higher distress levels than females in this dataset.  
- PTSD and depression exhibit a weak but positive relationship.  
- The Gaza Strip consistently shows higher levels of psychological distress, depression, and PTSD compared to the West Bank.  
- These findings underscore the importance of **region-specific and trauma-informed mental-health support**, particularly in high-conflict zones.
