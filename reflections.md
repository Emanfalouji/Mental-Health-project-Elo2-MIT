# ✨ Reflections

This document will capture my thoughts, decisions, challenges, and learning throughout the project.

## Why I Chose This Project
War-affected youth face immense psychological burdens that often remain invisible. I personally witnessed and experienced the impact of trauma, fear, and uncertainty — especially during the war in Gaza. This project is important to me because:

- I want to offer hope and emotional support to young people suffering in silence.
- I want to use technology to reduce suffering and make help accessible.
- I believe healing begins when someone truly listens and understands.

## What I Hope to Learn
- How mental-health support platforms are designed
- Trauma-aware UX and communication methods
- Ethical considerations when dealing with vulnerable users
- Turning user needs into real, practical platform features
